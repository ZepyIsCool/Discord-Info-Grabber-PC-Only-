# Discord-Info-Grabber-PC-Only-
This is a 100% legit logger. It will pull a user's token, billing info, and things such as. All you really need is a token to log into the account. I will be posting tutorials on coding and help with this soon, you can check the channel soon on YT. It's called CodingEasy.
 
 You will need a text editor such as notepad. Go to line 184 of the code then go to discord in a private server with just you I suggest and make a webhook.
  After you have created the webhook, copy the webhook URL and paste it in the quotation marks on line 184. Once finished, you can rename to make it look like a gamer or something and maybe ask someone to test your new game. 
  It should open a command prompt and then close for them and then it will send you the info on the discord server with the webhook.
